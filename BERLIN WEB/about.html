        <h2>What to know about Berlin</h2>
    </div>

        <h3>History of Berlin</h3>
        <p>Berlin's history begins with its founding in the 13th century. In 1417, it was made the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, then of Brandenburg-Prussia, and finally of the Kingdom of Prussia. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Prussia flourished swiftly, forming the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, which lasted until 1918, following the empire's loss in World War I.After 1900, Berlin rose to prominence as a global powerhouse in science, the humanities, music, museums, higher education, government, diplomacy, and military affairs. Manufacturing and finance were some areas where it played a part.Large portions of Berlin were destroyed by bombing, artillery, and brutal street-by-street warfare during World War II. Buildings would also be used to hide troops. The four major Allied powers were divided over Berlin. It epitomized the Cold War clash between the West and the East for nearly four decades. Berlin was reestablished as a capital and a prominent world city following Germany's reunification in 1990.</p>
